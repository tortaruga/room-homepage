## Overview

I think it works. I can never be sure, because at somepoint the layout changed whenever I refreshed the page, with the same exact grid behaving differently everytime, for who knows what ungodly reason. Maybe it's because last night I half-asleep thought to myself I'd sell my soul to the devil to be the most gorgeous creature to ever walk on earth, the devil took me seriously and this is what eternal damnation looks like. But I doubt it, since if anything I woke up looking even worse than usual.  

As always the JS started somewhat DRY and got progressively soppier until at the end it got as dry as a swimming pool, but the only way to fix it I can think of is creating and toggling classes, and that feels like too much work for now.

The design for middle sized screens was a total nightmare, because the designs provided look great on big and small screens, but suck big time on middle ones, and I had to desing that one myself, but I suck big time at designing. 
It was just one horrid chain of sucking big time.
Anyhow, it's not the prettiest, but it's my child, and I love it anyway.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

### What I learned

I've hated modal menus and dialog tags for the past two challenges, so this time I just used an empty div as backdrop. Take this, dialog! You thought you could stop me? Think again!

### Continued development

There's nothing new under the sun. I still hate grids. They still keep changing behavior just to spite me. I'm somehow getting both slightly better and slightly worse at writing DRY code. Becoming more familiar with Sass and BEM. Maybe one day I'll look back on this nightmare and smile.
